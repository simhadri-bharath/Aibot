Several ways exist to write a Java function that sums the numbers from 1 to 100. Here are a few, with explanations:

**Method 1: Using a loop (most straightforward)**

```java
public class Sum1To100 {

public static int sum1To100Loop() {
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) { sum +=i; } return sum; } public static void main(String[] args) { int
	sum=sum1To100Loop(); System.out.println("The sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is: " + sum);
    }
}
```

This method iterates through numbers 1 to 100, adding each to the `sum` variable.  It's easy to understand and works well for smaller ranges.

**Method 2: Using the mathematical formula (most efficient)**

The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:  `n * (n + 1) / 2`, where 'n' is the number of terms.

```java
public class Sum1To100 {

    public static int sum1To100Formula() {
        int n = 100;
        return n * (n + 1) / 2;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = sum1To100Formula();
        System.out.println(" The sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is: " + sum);
    }
}
```

This is significantly more efficient than the loop-based method, especially for large ranges, as it avoids iteration.

**Method 3: Using streams (Java 8 and above)**

Java 8 introduced streams, providing a functional approach:

```java
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class Sum1To100 {

    public static int sum1To100Streams() {
        return IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 100).sum();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = sum1To100Streams();
        System.out.println(" The sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is: " + sum);
    }
}
```

This uses `IntStream` to create a stream of integers from 1 to 100 and then uses the `sum()` method to calculate the total.  It's concise and readable but might have slightly higher overhead than the mathematical formula for this specific, small problem.

u
For summing numbers from 1 to 100, the mathematical formula (`sum1To100Formula`) is the most efficient.  For larger or more complex summation tasks, the loop or stream approaches might be more flexible.  Choose the method that best suits your needs and coding style. Remember to choose only *one* of these methods to include in your Java file.
